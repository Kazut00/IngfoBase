  "description": "An adventurer found what seems to be a sketch of a certain mountain out in the wild.\\nThis artwork was reckoned to have a most eye-pleasing balance of colors, and was imitated by a great many other artists.\\nBut due to the threat of monster attacks and the expenses required to hire armed guards, artists have never been able to find the spot from which this sketch was referenced to better study its inspiration.",
