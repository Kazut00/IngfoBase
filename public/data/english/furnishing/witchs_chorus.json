  "description": "A phonograph created using mysterious technologies that can store sounds.\\nThis phonograph seems to have been invented by a certain witch. It is of excellent quality, fears neither wind nor rain, and even scoffs at the erosion brought by sea salt. No matter the rhythmic complexity of the orchestration, it will play every last note from every last instrument with absolute clarity.",
