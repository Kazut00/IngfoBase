  "description": "A weapon rack that has used to mount Shogunate-style polearms. The shafts of these weapons have used the comparatively precious Aralia Wood, and have been treated to resist heat, such that they will not suddenly catch fire and be destroyed in the chaos of battle. This method is not actually the same as the one used to build their tent roofing, and they say that this method was developed long ago as a means of countering a certain species of monster. No reliable records exist that may attest to such a rumor, however.",
