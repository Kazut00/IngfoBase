  "description": "An often-seen Inazuman building that has had its two floors spliced together before it was divided horizontally into two sections. The original single-story area was designed as a restaurant, but some creative finagling by business people has seen it used to divide guests and staff. As such, one can see this construction used in many a restaurant or bookstore.",
