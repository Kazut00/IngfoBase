  "description": "An elegant folding screen that is made from the cores of somewhat-older Sandbearer Wood. The scarlet-tinted surface has a light fragrance. The fabric of the screen itself is satin-soft, depicting a merchant fleet as it cuts through the waves. It is said that this masterwork dates from the first days of Liyue Harbor and bears testament to the adventurous, risk-taking spirit of the people. To this day, it galvanizes those who strive onward â€” that it adds some extra celebratory color during a festival is another plus for sure.",
