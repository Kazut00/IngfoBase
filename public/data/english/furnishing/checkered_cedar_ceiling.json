Simple and lovely, it is a great match with furniture of all kinds.\\nThe main use of ceilings is to catch the dust that falls from the beams and other structures, and thus they have also gained the moniker \"Dust Bearers.\"\\nThey say that such honorific nicknames are given to many other things in Liyue: curtains, tables, chairs, table, and even Mora.",
