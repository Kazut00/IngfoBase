  "description": "A lantern made using purple fabric, just like the ones that can be seen hanging outside Tenshukaku. They are just a bit smaller in scale. Perhaps they may not do some exaggeratedly great like bringing the blessings of Her Excellency the Shogun down upon her people, but it can at least make people feel at ease.\\nPerhaps in another nation, there might be a rule that \"the commoners may not use items that imitate the style of the nobility or royalty.,\" but Inazuma's Shogun does not concern herself with such piddling, pointless pedantry.",
