  "description": "A valuable gift Ningguang gave to the Traveler after the reconstruction of the Jade Chamber.\\nThe elegant shape of the vase is crafted using the unique techniques of private craftsmen, and its surface is as smooth as a mirror, delicate as jade, and resistant to wear and tear. It is said that it took as long as six months to make the vase. The vase is planted with vibrant and fragrant plum blossoms. The plum blossoms were carefully selected and transplanted from Ningguang's private garden, who took the time to tend to the flowers herself. Both are invaluable, but more important is the symbolic meaning of this gift: wealth and moral character â€” equally indispensable.",
